              <div class="hide2" style="text-align:justify;">Transformers with advanced global relation modelling capabilities have recently been introduced to basic computer vision applications. The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a good illustration of how a pure transformer architecture may be immediately used to image classification by simply breaking images into tokens of a defined length and using transformers to learn relationships between these tokens. Such naive tokenization, on the other hand, has the potential to destroy object structures, assign grids to disinterested regions like the background, and produce interference signals. This paper deals the application of vision transformer.</div>

                <div class="hide2" style="text-align:justify;">With the development of society and the improvement of human health, chronic diseases have become the major killers. Along with the health-care business, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and respiratory diseases remain the leading killers for a decade in both developing and developing countries. Synthetic intelligence (AI) has emerged as  a  promising generation in healthcare with many applications, such as analysis, treatment,  prevention and billing systems in clinics. Nowadays, a wide variety of state-of-the-art technology has emerged to aid the use of ai in health care, including large numbers and mobile network networks. As a result, digital (e) -healthcare and scientific (m) -healthcare aims to obtain records, process them, and provide a well-defined outcome to the donor (medical doctor, affected person, or caregiver). Cell phone (m-health) is a term for health monitoring using cell phones and patient monitoring devices etc. It is often regarded as one of the greatest technological advances in modern times. More recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analysis within m-health have been used to provide an effective health care system. This is an important reason for the variety of informal and informal information due to the emergence of mobile applications and health care systems. In this paper, systematic reviews are performed on the use of AI and big    data analytics to improve the m-health system. Various algorithms based on AI and big data frameworks in terms of data source, strategies  used and  application area are discussed. This  paper explores the use of AI and big data analytics to give users insight and enable them to plan, using resources especially specific m-health challenges, and proposes an AI-based model and m-health big data analytics. The discovery of this paper will guide strategic planning using a combination of AI and big data as a source of effective m-health data management. The  evaluation of digital measures for therapeutic purposes depends on the capabilities of the  wearable technology to collect data and extract relevant patient management information. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques allow for the processing of real-time information  and further learning from data-building data. We have developed a system that can detect clinical feeling from digital initiatives based on native smartphone sensors and advanced machine  learning and signal processing techniques to detect suicide risk..</div>

                security flaws of CAPTCHA generating model in order to build more resilient CAPTCHAs without such risks associated with human attempt and fail attempts. In this work, a more efficient DOCR-CAPTCHA model has presented which is deep learning approach based on an optical character recognition
                (OCR) to address the concerns of lower efficiency and inadequate performance of existing CAPTCHA detection algorithms. First, the DOCR-CAPTCHA model preprocesses the images to enhance the quality by following gray scale conversion, cropping and resizing the image. Second, it extracts the character to create a dictionary and mapping each character with labeling. Next, it performs classification using OCR technique and train the model. It also performed the validation on the same data. The simulation has done on the CAPTCHA images dataset. The recognition rate of this
                simulated model results achieved a high accuracy rate of 99.98 percent and minimized error rate of 0.0051 for the CAPTCHA train dataset. It has also compared with the existing technique and found that it has outperformed than YOLO.</div>

The agriculture productivity can be increased of the by the detect plant disease at the early stage. The automated techniques plays an important role to detect diseases at early stage and detection will be accurate. The automated techniques detect the disease when the symptoms are start appearing on the leave of the plant. This paper presents an automated technique for the plant disease detection which is based on the four operations which are pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. This paper also covers literature survey of various techniques which are already proposed by the authors. The symptoms analysis of the plant leaf is done using GLCM algorithm and classification of the disease is done using voting classification which are key aspects of this paper. The voting classification method is the combination of the decision trees, support vector machines, k nearest neighbor methods which will improvise accuracy of the disease detection at early stage.</div>

                <div class="hide2" style="text-align:justify;">A stroke is a life-threatening medical condition which can cause serious issues to people and their loved ones. Stroke symptoms include difficulty walking, speaking, and comprehending, as well as facial paralysis or numbness. Early therapy with TPA (clot buster) can help to prevent brain injury. Other therapies aim to reduce consequences and
                prevent further strokes. Then the blood in the body which flows through flow is stopped the brain tissues are deprived of the required amount of oxygen and nutrients which are required for the functioning of the brain properly, results in a stroke and within some time the brain cells begin to die. Stroke is considered to be the world’s second-largest cause of death according to the statistics, and it is continuing to be one of the biggest health burden for both people and national healthcare system. It is considered as a big medical emergency which includes risk factors such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes, glucose metabolism dysregulation. The method proposed by the authors give an idea to the researchers about which is the best method to use from adaboost, SVM, random forest classifier, Xgboost and logistic regression.</div>

                <div> <i>Status:- Accepted for 2021 Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Multi-Disciplinary Research </i></div>                
                <div class="hide2" style="text-align:justify;">Diabetic retinopathy is a serious eye disease that can lead to blindness and affects the majority of diabetics. When the patient observes tiny challenges, the disease begins without any symptoms. The retina can already be irreparably altered by vision. Prevention is a viable option. Regular eye examinations can help you achieve this. They are time consuming. Diabetic retinopathy can be detected using a variety of ways. Fundus photos have been discovered. The convolution neural networks produced the best results. The goal of this research is to use several ways to address the challenge of detecting diabetic retinopathy. Several methods are used to develop and improve a solution for a single image classification: using state-of-the-art architectures and methods, blending predictions from both eyes of a person, using unlabeled data, using additional input in the form of vessel segmentation masks, and ensemble classification. Using additional input and training on unlabeled data can improve the results of a single model. Using a shalow neural network design yielded the greatest ensemble results..</div>

                <div> <i>Status:- Accepted for 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING SCIENCES (ICCS-2021) [IEEE] </i></div>                
                <div class="hide2" style="text-align:justify;">Abstract—ML (machine learning) is consisted of a method of recognizing face. This technique is useful for the attendance system. Two sets are generated for testing and training phases in order to segment the image, to extract the features and develop a dataset. An image is considered as a testing set; the training set is contrasted when it is essential to identify an image. An ensemble classifier is implemented to classify the test images as recognized or non-recognized. The ensemble algorithm fails to acquire higher accuracy as it classifies the data in two classes. Thus, GLCM is projected with the purpose of analyzing the texture attributes to detect the face. The attendance of the query image is marked after detecting the face. The simulation outcomes revealed the superiority of the projected technique over the traditional methods concerning accuracy.</div>
